DataGenRamco
============

Repo to store, share and collaborate on the Project at Ramco Systems, where we build an enterprise tool for Data analysis, Report generation, Query optimization and Consistency checks.


The DataGen project is a part of a broader range of technological upgrades currently being undertaken at Ramco Systems (www.ramco.com). Currently, there are some regular tasks being done manually, which can be replaced by automated applications and this project comprises of a handful of such tasks - Consistency Query execution (to check for database consistencies), Transaction Statistics, Month-end Reconciliation, Report Generation, Data Analysis and visual representation and flagging capabilities for all these tasks.

There are plans to make this both as an offline as well as online tool.

For online, we have identified Django as the technology that we are going to use - mainly because of the extensively supported python libraries and data analysis and visualization tools available already.

For offline, we might go with Visual Studio and C# as suggested by the organization, or we might go for a Django ported desktop app.
